          A carpooling application designed to tackle the ongoing transportation issue by harnessing the power of sharing economy.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          During the hackathon and entrepreneurship program held by <a href="http://inacademy.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">European Innovation Academy</a> in the summer of 2014, our team worked on a project to connect people on the road — a mobile application called DriveEarth (now <a href="http://wever.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Wever</a>).
        </p>

          <embed src="/images/driveearth_slide.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" class="rounded-lg border border-gray-200" />
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">My Role</h2>
        <p>
          The final product is a workable and responsive prototype that was built with Fluid UI. It contains all of the user cases we were trying to address and combines a fun eco-friendly framework (gamification) with a real time and traditional carpooling service to drivers and passengers. I took on the role to design app wireframing, icons, logo, pitch slides and typography of drive-earth.net (currently <a href="http://wever.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">wever.fr</a>), which led to the creation of an app mockup and the first version of our website.
        </p>

        <p>
          To achieve the fun aspect of our carpooling application (gamification), a set of character designs (birdies) were carried out using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. Character attributes were taken from RPG games to give a sense of developing a perfect digital companion while ordering/sharing rides with others. The tuned down version of the neon color scheme was a tribute to games from the 80s and 90s.
